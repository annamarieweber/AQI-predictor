Maximized the utilization of the sterilizers by designing product pallet stacking configurations using a software program specifically designed to volumetrically optimize product loading. 3. Product batches were built to completely fill each pallet and a full load of 8 pallets was run through each sterilization cycle to minimize the amount of ethylene oxide used and maximize efficiency. 4. The sterilization processes are designed and validated to use the lowest effective concentration of ethylene oxide necessary to sterilize our products. 5. Standard operating procedures for each sterilization cycle mandate test protocols designed to detect any leaks in the system prior to introduction of ethylene oxide into the sterilization chamber. Ethylene oxide is introduced to each cycle only after the test cycle is successfully complete for every cycle run. If a problem is detected, the cycle is aborted prior to the introduction of ethylene oxide into the chamber, reducing waste and eliminating any potential leakage due to equipment failure.",""

The gas addressed by the FGTU is material that has been traditionally sent to flare as necessary without further sulfur-recovery treatment. In the event of malfunction or non-availability of this unit, such gases would still go directly to flare. The additional equipment and operation is aimed at reducing intermittent flare emissions of sulfur dioxide, particularly during certain periods of startup/shutdown and malfunction. Sulfur material captured during such periods is stored on-site as amine salts for subsequent treatment and resource recovery in the existing fuel gas treatment facility (MSCC's amine unit) and MSCC's sulfur recovery plant during normal operation of those portions of the facility. The FGTU uses an amine treatment contactor to remove H2S from selected gases during these situations prior to flaring, along with liquid storage. Storage allows deferred processing and high-rate operation. Consequently, successful operation of the FGTU reduces SO2 (and H2S) emissions otherwise arising as a result from flaring.",""

In addition, our sanitation chemical supplier has conducted several optimization reviews with our teams to identify areas for additional chemical reduction.  These reviews have resulted in shorter cleaning cycles, reductions in chemical concentrations, and removal of one chemical from the site.  Several projects have been conducted at the site to remove unnecessary piping and shorten the lengths of existing piping to improve operational efficiency and reduce water and chemical use.  In addition, we have reconfigured some of our cleaning systems to re-use the solution from the final cleaning step in the first step of the next cleaning cycle.  The site has achieved the greatest success in the reduction of nitric acid use, as this is a primary component of multiple sanitation chemicals.  This has the added benefit of reducing the site's generation of nitrate compounds to levels below reportable quantities for multiple years since 2012.  The quantities of several other chemicals have also been reduced at the site.  This was due largely to the optimization measures taken and the replacement of some sanitation chemicals with products using other components.  While improvements to date have been substantial, the employees of the Agawam Plant continue to look for opportunities to reduce overall chemical use in all of the sites operations.  We have gleaned all of the low and mid-level fruit from the tree and we are now working on the few pieces remaining that are the hardest to reach and provide the smallest results.  Regardless, we will continue to look for new opportunities to reduce, eliminate, or substitute the chemicals being used throughout our operations.",""
