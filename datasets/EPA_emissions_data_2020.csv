Maximized the utilization of the sterilizers by designing product pallet stacking configurations using a software program specifically designed to volumetrically optimize product loading. 3. Product batches were built to completely fill each pallet and a full load of 8 pallets was run through each sterilization cycle to minimize the amount of ethylene oxide used and maximize efficiency. 4. The sterilization processes are designed and validated to use the lowest effective concentration of ethylene oxide necessary to sterilize our products. 5. Standard operating procedures for each sterilization cycle mandate test protocols designed to detect any leaks in the system prior to introduction of ethylene oxide into the sterilization chamber. Ethylene oxide is introduced to each cycle only after the test cycle is successfully complete for every cycle run. If a problem is detected, the cycle is aborted prior to the introduction of ethylene oxide into the chamber, reducing waste and eliminating any potential leakage due to equipment failure.",""

Therefore, we did not process and recycle (send off-site) any production or returned goods.  We are currently developing a more efficient way of processing our rejected or returned switches.  Due to the disposal costs increasing so much over the last couple years, we must remove the copper coil from the switch to allow us to dispose of more switches per barrel.

The facility utilizes proven 3rd party waste vendors. The site has recycled or sent for alternative use 97.70% of its total generated waste. This is an important metric for us as it keeps this waste out of landfills and reduces our environmental impact.Other Environmental Practices: Waste Treatment - 100% of our ethylene glycol waste goes to a waste water treatment place that treats and recycles our waste water.Barriers to P2: Mixing and production equipment are closed systems located on secondary containment and/or within a trenched floor and collection system. Waste storage tanks have secondary containment. Chemical product is stored on secondary containment pallets or in our designated chemical storage areas with secondary containment.Barriers to P2: We are already diluting the ethylene glycol down to as little approximately 5-6% in water in order to facilitate the testing operations and still allow the chemical to perform it's intended duty.Barriers to P2: Engineering has determined the minimum required amount to be mixed with our test water to a) reduce chemical on hand which limits potential environmental exposure, b) comply with quality standards, and c) reduce overall cost of production.Barriers to P2: Ethylene glycol is a standard product used in pressure testing to provide a stable test medium as well as corrosion and freeze inhibitor for our products.",""

All manufacturing facilities worldwide have been third-party certified to the ISO 14001 standard. Ford Motor Company has implemented a minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) machining process (also called near-dry machining) that reduces waste by more than 80 percent for each engine we produce, also saving oil and water. This dry-machining process lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil, rather than the conventional wet-machining that required large amounts of metalworking fluids and water to cool and lubricate the tools. For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. Additionally, MQL reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more. And by avoiding the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL helps to reduce energy use. MQL also improves plant air quality by eliminating the airborne mist produced by traditional wet-machining.",""

Source Reduction: Methods for Identifying Pollution Prevention Opportunities - In developing reduction strategies for consideration, Tresca reviewed trade publications and EPA databases, hired an outside technical consultant to examine operating practices, and solicited employee suggestions regarding toxic use reduction.Barriers to P2: Cement and fly ash are delivered in bulk and are added directly into the final product by an automated system. Waste concrete is recycled.Barriers to P2: Cement and fly ash contain trace amount of lead, and are used in the manufacturing of ready made concrete. The cement used by Tresca contains approximately 5 ppm lead, and the fly ash contains approximately 0.82 ppm lead. Fly ash affects the plastic properties of concrete by improving workability, reducing water demand, reducing segregation and bleeding, and lower heat of hydration. Fly ash increases strength, reduces permeability, reduces corrosion of reinforcing steel, increases sulfate resistance, and reduces alkali-aggregate reaction. Concrete made with fly ash reaches its maximum strength more slowly than concrete.Barriers to P2: The use of fly ash in concrete manufacturing is beneficial recycling. Fly ash is a byproduct of coal fired electric generation plants. The use of fly ash byproduct in the manufacture of concrete offers several environmental advantages, such as the diverting the materials from the waste stream, reducing the energy investment in processing virgin materials, conserving virgin materials, and allaying pollution.",""

In addition, the reaction takes place in a fully-enclosed reactor that typically operates at or slightly below atmospheric pressure, with vents routed to a scrubber. During normal operations the process produces no waste, and spent scrubber water is recycled back into the process and/or incorporated into other saleable products.Barriers to P2: The current manufacturing process does not produce any waste and all formaldehyde is consumed in the reaction to make a final product. Any formaldehyde in drip trays or scrubber water is placed back into the process and reacted to consume it.Source Reduction: Ways P2 Was Incorporated in Original Process Design - The design of the formaldehyde storage tanks and reactors was intended to limit the potential for any uncontrolled releases. Although not a closed-loop process, all vents are controlled by a two-stage monoethanolamine (MEA)/water scrubber, which removes >95% of the formaldehyde vapor from the tank and reactor vent streams.

The gas addressed by the FGTU is material that has been traditionally sent to flare as necessary without further sulfur-recovery treatment. In the event of malfunction or non-availability of this unit, such gases would still go directly to flare. The additional equipment and operation is aimed at reducing intermittent flare emissions of sulfur dioxide, particularly during certain periods of startup/shutdown and malfunction. Sulfur material captured during such periods is stored on-site as amine salts for subsequent treatment and resource recovery in the existing fuel gas treatment facility (MSCC's amine unit) and MSCC's sulfur recovery plant during normal operation of those portions of the facility. The FGTU uses an amine treatment contactor to remove H2S from selected gases during these situations prior to flaring, along with liquid storage. Storage allows deferred processing and high-rate operation. Consequently, successful operation of the FGTU reduces SO2 (and H2S) emissions otherwise arising as a result from flaring.",""
